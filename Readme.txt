This project is based around a pair of 433MHz RF modules (Transmitter and reciever) connected to 2 Arduino Boards.
To use this code you must Download the Virtual Wire Library for RF Modules.
The link for Virtual Wire Library is :- https://github.com/m0/Updated-Arduino-VirtualWire-Library
The transmitter Arduino has a Joystick attached to it which is used to send commands to the reciever Arduino board.
The Reciever Board is connected to an L298N Motor Driver Module which is used to decipher signals and execute specific functions.
